## Summary
*A collection of utility functions and templates to speed code development.*  

## Project Description
The tony_util package contains various utilities that I have developed
during the process of learning the python language and during project development.  

Some utilities, such as the log_util.py logging routines are qa/qc'd and well documented.
Other utilities are more akin to scratch code that I may develop further at some point.

The templates folder contains boilerplate information for documentation
purposes and notes on jupyter usage.

## Usage

1) Copy the folder tony_util to your system
2) Ensure the folder that contains tony_util is on your python search path. 
   * See: https://docs.python.org/2/using/windows.html
3) import file of interest in the package.
   * for example: import tony_util.misc
